# Saga in Microservices

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

**Saga** is a design pattern in microservices used to manage **distributed transactions** without relying on ACID transactions.

<Callout type="info">
It breaks a large operation into **local steps**.  
If a step fails, **compensating actions** are executed to undo the previous steps.
</Callout>

## Types of Saga

### 1. Choreographed (Most used)
Each service **reacts to events** independently, without a central coordinator.

### 2. Orchestrated
A **central service** coordinates the saga steps, instructing each service what action to perform.

<Callout type="warning">
Orchestration is less used because it requires a central coordinator that can cause bottle necks.
</Callout>
